# Data Cleaning Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning, focusing on preparing raw datasets for analysis by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring data integrity. The primary objective is to create a clean, structured, and reliable dataset ready for further analysis or modeling.

## Features
- **Handling Missing Values:** Identifies and treats missing data using appropriate strategies such as imputation or removal.
- **Data Type Conversion:** Ensures all columns have correct data types.
- **Outlier Detection and Treatment:** Detects and handles outliers using statistical methods.
- **Data Standardization:** Standardizes column names and formats for consistency.
- **Duplicate Removal:** Identifies and removes duplicate entries in the dataset.
- **Validation and Export:** Validates cleaned data and exports it to a file format of choice.

## File Overview
- **`Data_cleaning.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains the entire data cleaning workflow, including code and detailed explanations.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn (install using `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`)

## Usage

   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Data_cleaning.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to clean your dataset.

## Example
The notebook includes example datasets to demonstrate the cleaning process. Users can replace these with their own datasets for cleaning.
